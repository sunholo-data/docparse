  Verify generated Office documents (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT, ODP, ODS, HTML) are valid
  and open correctly. Use when: user asks to verify generated files, check document output
  quality, validate Office files, run the verification loop, test generated documents,
  check if files open in Keynote/Word/Numbers, or after changing any generator code
  (docx_generator, pptx_generator, xlsx_generator, odt_generator, odp_generator,
  ods_generator, html_generator). Also use when user says "verify", "check the files",
  "do they open", "run verification", or "test the output".

# Verify Generated Documents

Run the document generation verification loop to check that generated Office files are structurally valid, open in Python libraries, and roundtrip through DocParse correctly.

## What This Does

Three levels of verification on all files in `data/examples/`:

1. **L1 Structure** — ZIP well-formedness, required entries present, XML validity
2. **L2 Library** — python-docx, python-pptx, openpyxl open without errors
3. **L4 Roundtrip** — Parse through DocParse, verify blocks are preserved

## Usage

Run the verification script:

```bash
uv run --with python-pptx --with openpyxl --with python-docx benchmarks/verify_generated.py
```

### With Regeneration

If generator code has changed, regenerate demo files first, then verify:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/verify-docs/scripts/regen_and_verify.sh
```

### Quick Verify Only (no regen)

```bash
bash .claude/skills/verify-docs/scripts/verify_only.sh
```

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. Check if the user passed `--regen` or asked to regenerate files
2. If regenerating: run `scripts/regen_and_verify.sh` which generates fresh demo files across all formats then verifies
3. If verify only: run `scripts/verify_only.sh`
4. Report results clearly — highlight any FAIL or WARN items
5. If there are failures, investigate the specific XML/structure issue and suggest fixes
6. After fixing generator code, re-run verification to confirm the fix

## Interpreting Results

- **PASS** — File is valid at that level
- **WARN** — Minor issue (e.g., ODF mimetype compression — AILANG stdlib limitation, not fixable by us)
- **FAIL** — File won't open correctly in target applications. Needs a fix in the generator code.

## Known Limitations

- ODF files (ODT/ODP/ODS) have compressed mimetype entries — this is an AILANG `createArchive` limitation (no store/no-compress flag). Shows as WARN, not FAIL.
- Level 3 (native app smoke test) is manual — open files in Keynote/Word/Numbers to verify visually.
